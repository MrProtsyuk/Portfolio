        <p>Hey! My name is Mark Protsyuk and I am a young software developer born and raised in the Sacramento area. I have been programming for a little under a year with my first tase of programming in American River College. I have recently finished the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp (certification below) and I am ready to be a part of a team. Outside of coding, I love to explore new interests like art and physical activites. It helps me push myself and expericence new things, which help me step out of my comfort zone. Programming has been one of those ventures that I fell in love with, check out some of things I have made below!</p>
